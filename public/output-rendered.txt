The Importance of Roof Design and Outdoor Space

This document explores several architectural patterns focused on creating welcoming outdoor spaces and designing roofs that evoke a sense of shelter and integration with the building.

Outdoor Spaces:

Parking as an Outdoor Room: Design parking spaces as inviting extensions of the house rather than mere gaps in the terrain. Ensure a clear, aesthetically pleasing path connects the parking space to the main entrance, leading through the entrance to both the kitchen and living areas (INTIMACY GRADIENT, COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART, OUTDOOR ROOM).

Hierarchical Outdoor Spaces: Structure outdoor spaces in a hierarchy, with smaller spaces flowing into larger ones, to provide a sense of openness and connection to the surroundings. Each space should offer a "back" (a protected area) and a "view" (a vista onto a larger space). Examples include:

Garden seats facing gardens (GARDEN SEAT, HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN)

Activity pockets opening to public squares (ACTIVITY POCKETS, SMALL PUBLIC SQUARE)

Gardens opening to local roads (PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, LOOPED LOCAL ROAD)

Roads opening to fields (GREEN STREETs, ACCESSIBLE GREENs)

Fields offering vistas of the countryside (COMMON LAND, THE COUNTRYSIDE)

Lively Courtyards: Design courtyards to be inviting and well-integrated with the surrounding building. Avoid overly enclosed spaces by providing:

Ambiguous transitions between indoors and outdoors, like porches or verandas.

Multiple entrances from the building to encourage circulation.

Views into larger spaces beyond the courtyard.

Roof Design:

Cascading Roofs: Design roofs that cascade downwards, with the highest point at the center and gradually stepping down towards the edges. This approach offers several benefits:

Social: Larger gathering spaces with higher ceilings occupy the center, while smaller rooms are situated towards the edges.

Structural: Creates a self-buttressing system by distributing weight effectively.

Practical: Allows for roof gardens on lower levels, connected directly to the living spaces they serve (ROOF GARDENS).

Sheltering Roofs: A roof should evoke a sense of shelter and protection. To achieve this:

Integrate living spaces within the roof volume rather than simply placing them underneath.

Ensure the roof is a visually prominent feature of the building.

Bring the eaves low enough in certain areas, like entrances, to allow for physical contact.

Combining Sloped and Flat Roofs: Utilize a mix of steeply pitched/vaulted roofs and flat roofs.

Sloped/vaulted roofs provide shelter and can incorporate living spaces (SHELTERING ROOF, ROOF VAULTS, BULK STORAGE, ARCADE, GALLERY SURROUND).

Flat roofs are suitable for roof gardens (ROOF GARDENS).

Roof Details:

Incorporate dormer windows for rooms situated within the roof (DORMER WINDOWS).

For complex building plans, carefully consider the intersection of different roof slopes (ROOF LAYOUT).

By carefully considering these patterns, architects can create buildings and outdoor spaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing, fostering a sense of comfort and connection with the surrounding environment.
